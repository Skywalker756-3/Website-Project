            You want to have tea time with a puppy and we've got you covered. Enjoy our state of the art tea brewed with the finest 
            precision and the most bewildering ingredients. All the while you get swarmed by only the most aristocratic of puppies that have been
            well trained in the art of tea and fine dining.
