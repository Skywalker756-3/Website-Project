# Puppy Cafe Website

The following text outlines the creation process of the webpage as per Part 1.

## Purpose

The design is tailored to deleiver this these main goals from users
- Inform potential customers of what a puppy cafe is.
- Inform users of the location (Minimal online interaction since it's heavily in person experiences).
- Entice users into visiting.
- Make it easy for the owners to add/remove puppies to the cafe's site.

The webpage must also be accessible and well tailored for mobile users as well.


## UI / UX Decisions

At the top of the page we show off the puppies in a slideshow format, this is a priority because the puppies are a defining feature of the business model, making it stand out. 

We have a navigation bar which serves to direct users to common goals that they have including finding
and contacting the cafe, adopting puppies, the menu and events. To keep the navigation bar clean across platforms we had to reduce the amount of text on each button, this comes at the cost of potentially unclear buttons but it's worth it since most of them are straight forward.

One unique user experience decision we made was to delay the loading of formats and scripting before the webpages content was fully loaded.
This prevents the page from looking bad for a moment but in term it enhances the user experience, they don't run the risk of the page shifting when loading and they don't have to see a skeleton of the actual webpage.

Accessibility
- Text is made readable with a  font
- Images and video come with text alternatives for visually impaired
- Subtitles were added to the video

## Challenges

Designing the website brought some challenges for me since I was relatively new to webdesign
but I got the hand of it quickly due to my previous experience with javascript and other programming
languages. The most difficult part was trying to get the webpage look like the wireframe, padding and positioning
of elements can be frustrating.

We also opted to use Github to collaborate on the project, so we had to 
familiarize ourselves with the version control system and pushing and pulling from
the remote repository.
