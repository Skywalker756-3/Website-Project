Welcome to Los Angles! The home of Hollywood and now...

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.000
It's very own dog cafe!

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Local residents can come along to get their caffeine and canine fix in one place!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.500
Buying a cup of coffee and entering the adjacent puppy lounge...

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.000
To play with the lovely pooches, all of which are up for adoption.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Owner: So I actually grew up in Korea, I frequented a lot of dog cafe's there and I really got involved in the animal rescue work there... 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Owner: and when I came here I visited a shelter within the first month that I was here. And I realized there was such a greater intake of dogs than there were adoptions...

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Owner: and I was like: "What's a good way to combat this?" and so I was like: "Why not bring a little bit of home back from Korea here but implement the dog adoption aspect of things as well"

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The LA Dog Cafe is already incredibly popular and due to high demand, charges a 10$ entrance fee

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This will get you cup of coffee and fifty five minutes of puppy playing

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Customer: I love it so far, you just get to sit, hangout and chill with dogs. What else can you ask for?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So next time your desperate for your double expresso head to Los Angles, you'll be barking not to.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
